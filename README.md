### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Zachary (he/him/his), a MEng Computer Science student at Queen's University Belfast. I have a particular interest in Computational Biology, High-Performance Computing, and Graphics/ Physics Engines.

I've only recently begun tracking my projects on GitHub so expect to see more from me here soon.
